# Midtrans Payment API Integration (Golang)

This project is a learning-based implementation of an API service focused on integrating with the **Midtrans payment gateway**. Initially started in **2020**, the purpose of this project is to gain deeper understanding of **third-party payment systems** and to improve practical experience in building **RESTful APIs using Go (Golang)**.

## 🧠 Purpose

- Learn and implement secure, real-world API integration with Midtrans.
- Understand the workflow of online payments using third-party gateways.
- Improve skills in Golang backend development, database management, and API design.

## 🚀 What's New

This project has been upgraded and improved over time:

- ✅ **Golang upgrade**: Migrated from Go `v1.15` to **Go `v1.24`** for better performance and modern features.
- ✅ **Database migration**: Switched from **MySQL** to **PostgreSQL** for more robust and scalable data handling.
- ✅ **Midtrans Gateway Refresh**: Updated the Midtrans payment logic to align with the latest API specs and security best practices.
